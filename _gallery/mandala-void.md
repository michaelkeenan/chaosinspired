title: Mandala of the Void
description:
  That which can be written, is not the void.<br />
  That which can be spoken is not the void.<br />
  That which can be seen is not the void.<br />
  That which can be touched, is not the void.<br />
  That which can be grasped, is not the void...<br />
  Neither that which is nor that which can be, are the void. <br />
  The void is naught of naught<br />
  The void is all that is nothing<br />
  And nothing that is anything.<br />
